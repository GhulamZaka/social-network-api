# social-network-api

- This API allows users to apply CRUD operations on users, thoughts, adding friends and reactions.
- It can display different sections with all information and ID based details.
- This application can be tested via insomnia.

In this API we use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the two above packages, we also used npm(Getter) package to format timestamps.
